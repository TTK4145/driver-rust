# Rust Driver for Elevator project

To use this library add the following to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
driver-rust = { git = "https://github.com/TTK4145/driver-rust", tag = "v0.X.0" }
```

For most recent release see [releases](https://github.com/TTK4145/driver-rust/releases). Note
that we will come with breaking changes to `master`, so depending on the `master` branch directly
might lead to some issues.

For an example of usage, see [main.rs](src/main.rs).
